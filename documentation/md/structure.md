# Project Structure and Architecture

## 7-1 Pattern

In this project I have used the 7-1 pattern as described by Hugo Giraudel on [Sass Guidelines](https://sass-guidelin.es/#architecture).

The Sass files are split in to contextual folders:

1. base
2. components
3. layout
4. pages
5. themes
6. abstracts
7. vendors
